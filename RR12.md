 < canvas >
*  element is similar to an < img > element, without src and alt attributes.
*  It holds the width and height attribute optionally and can be set using the DOM properties.
* If left undefined, it will auto to 300 wide and 150 high.
* You can control via CSS, but during rendering the image is scaled to fit its layout size \\ if CSS sizing doesn’t respect the ratio of the original canvas, it can appear distorted. 
* You should provide fallback content for older browsers
* Requires a closing tag
